Given this scenario below:


Break the scenario down to the subject of interest involved. Then, create a debate template that can be used to argue for or against for each of the subject of interest. The debate template should include opening arguments, a structure for the debate, and general tips for debating. The debate would be between agents that is part of a conversation.




## Debate Structure and Tips
### 1. Case Construction

- Brainstorm reasons supporting your position
- Group arguments into categories (economic, social, political)
- Prioritize arguments and create taglines (contentions)
- Develop 3 unique, non-contradictory contentions
- For each contention, provide:
  - Clear claim
  - Supporting evidence
  - Relevance to the topic

### 2. Refutation

- Listen carefully and take notes on opponent's arguments
- Identify claim, evidence, and relevance of each contention
- Use "THEY SAY, I SAY BECAUSE" format to refute
- Address all parts: claim, evidence, relation to topic
- Avoid straw man arguments
- Be strategic, agree where appropriate while emphasizing your case's strength

### 3. Case Rebuilding

- Anticipate objections during preparation
- Don't reveal refutations in advance
- Use "THEY SAY, I SAY BECAUSE" structure
- Add new analysis, evidence, and examples

### 4. Closing Remarks

- Focus on new analysis of previous points, not new arguments
- Address points of clash (economic, social, political)
- Explain why your side prevails on these issues

## General Tips

- Take thorough notes
- Maintain confidence
- Focus on refuting the case, not personal attacks
- Be engaging and use appropriate body language
- Employ humor to connect with the audience
